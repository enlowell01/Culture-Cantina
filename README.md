# Culture-Cantina

## The third and final NCSU Web Development bootcamp project
Created by Evan Lowell, Luis Lewis Pimentel, Ligia De Lara, and Zach Mathias. A 2-week project, DUE by 9/26/2023

## Culture Cantina Description
Culture Cantina is a full-stack MERN application where users can browse movies, search for their favorites and leave ratings and reviews for each movie. Users can display their ratings and reviews on their profiles and view profiles of other users.

### Culture Cantina Demo
**Hosted Web Page**:

### Tech Stack
This application is a standard MERN Stack. Our collections are contained in Mongo DB, and powered with Express, React, and Node.js. 
Movie information is sourced through the TMDB API. User information is stored in a Mongo DB and is protected with b-crypt. This looks nice thanks to react and bootstrap.
A full list of dependencies can be found in the packages files.
To start locally, run NPM RUN DEV in the backend and NPM START in the frontend.

### Functions:
- Users should be able to search the TMDB database through our Culture Cantina for movies to review.
- Users should be able to CREATE a new profile to interact with the app and leave reviews.
- Users should be able to CREATE a new review/rating for each movie 1 time. If a review for a title exists, they cannot create a second one.
- Users should be able to READ information on the homepage for popular movies, as well as other profiles and ratings/reviews.
- Users should be able to UPDATE their reviews/ratings.
- Users should be able to DELETE their reviews/ratings and their profiles, but only their profiles, ratings, and reviews.

### Issues/Bugs/Fixes:

- No current outstanding bugs

### Future of Culture-Cantina
This project has evolved quite a bit since its initial inception. One day, we would like this project to grow into a multi-media social hub where users can not only perform the above functions for Movies, but also do the same for TV, Books, Music, Games, and more.
**Future Features**:
- Allow users to upload their own user images
- Allow users to create collections of media they would like to watch, have watched/own, etc.
- Allow users to add other profiles as friends and share ratings/reviews/discussions
